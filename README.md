# The beginning of the story
It was the summer of 2015 (i was around 13 years old) when a question occupied my mind, what does programming mean?
And the next day I wrote my first `Hello, World!!`

This repository contains my first codes and programming training that i have done with `Microsoft Small Basic` language.

## First Hello World
The first line of code I wrote.
```
TextWindow.WriteLine("HELLO , WORLD")
```
[Here](https://github.com/ShahnamFeyzian/The-beginning-of-the-story/blob/main/first%20hello%20world/hello%20world.sb) is the source code.


## List of Divisor
This was my first program that actually did something useful.

[Here](https://github.com/ShahnamFeyzian/The-beginning-of-the-story/blob/main/first%20for%20statements/prog6-4.sb) is the source code.

## Sierpinski Triangle
This program takes a number and randomly turns the same number of pixels in the allowed areas yellow.

## Rotating Shapes With Turtle
This program takes two numbers, the first is the number of repetitions of the shape and the second is the number of sides of the shape.
